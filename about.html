    <h1>About Jesse Velichko</h1>

    <p>I think a good way to know someone is to ask them what their goals and priorities are. Some of mine are the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>To care and provide for my family. Love is an action, not a feeling, and I want to make sure my family knows I love them.</li>
      <li>To always be learning and improving. I've found solving IT problems is something that I have a passion for, and I never want to stop discovering more challenges.</li>
      <li>To be there for others and provide the help they need to succeed. If I go through a crappy day, but it ends up with someone completing their goal, then it was worth it. </li>
    </ul>
